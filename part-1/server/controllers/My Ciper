I saw the instructions and I was not really sure how to code a my cipher. I remember one of the first ciphers I learned about was the rot 13 which would take the alphabet and change each letter exactly 13 letters down in the alphabet.

I decided to make a simple one that would do something similar but go back words 3 letters. Its simple but it will work.

Here is is the code

const ci3 = (message) => {
  const originalAlpha = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
  const cipher = "xyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW"
  return message.replace(/[a-z]/gi, letter => cipher[originalAlpha.indexOf(letter)])
}
console.log(ci3('I love cryptopgyphy'))
console.log(ci3('F ilsb zovmqlmdvmevâ€™))

I simple define the original alphabet and the new cipher. Then use the .replace to go through the letters and then the cipher.

I was not able to get the I love cryptography code to work because it just takes the coded message and goes back 3 letters.
