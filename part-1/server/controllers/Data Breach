					Yahoo in 2013


I do remember this one because I had a Yahoo account but I never really used the email. In 2013 a hacker group was able to get access to 3 billion accounts. 
At first Yahoo didn’t really admit how many accounts were hacked. They were in the process of being bought by Verizon and I am sure they wanted to keep hush 
on the reality of the situation. Hackers were able to get usernames and passwords. 

They eventually admitted it and sent details about the hack to the accounts that had been hacked. Luckily I didn’t have any sensitive information on my 
own Yahoo account. I get made fun of still to this day but I still used my original Hotmail account. Verizon eventually did by Yahoo and assured users 
that they are committed to nothing but the best in the industry standards, as far as protection goes. Pretty much a bunch of political correctness jargon.

Yahoo was sued and fined by the SEC commission. Ironically one of things Yahoo did to insure a safer email account was implementing bcrypt which we learned about today. 
That way they can make passwords more secure for all the user accounts. They asked affected users to change their passwords right away. 
They also worked closely with law enforcement to continue to safe guard accounts.
